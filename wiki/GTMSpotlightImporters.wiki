Finding source can be difficult. We've built up some importers to help you index your source files.

The installer for the importers is [http://google-toolbox-for-mac.googlecode.com/files/DeveloperSpotlightImporters.pkg.zip here], and contains the following three importers:
== !AppleScript Importer ==
Imports source and description from !AppleScript .scpt and .scptd files.

== Interface Builder Importer ==
Imports custom class names, bindings, outlets, actions and localizable strings from .xib and .nib files.

Requires Xcode 3 or better (specifically needs ibtool to be available).

== Xcode Project Importer ==
Imports file names and project comments from .xcodeproj files.

Requires Xcode 2.4 or better.
