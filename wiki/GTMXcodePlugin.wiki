= Introduction =

The GTM Xcode plugin adds a couple of nice features to Xcode.
   # A preference to clean up end of line white space from text files.
   # A "Create Unit Test Executable" menu item to make it easier to debug unit tests.
   # Some quick links under the "Help" menu to some useful documentation. 
   # Some menu items for working with [http://code.google.com/p/coverstory/ Coverstory]

It is available under [http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/downloads/list downloads]. 
= Installation =
The install path is a little difficult, but the plugin should be extracted from its Zip file and should be put into:

  * "/Library/Application Support/Developer/3.1/Xcode/Plug-ins" for development on Leopard

and

  * "/Library/Application Support/Developer/3.2/Xcode/Plug-ins" for development on Snow Leopard

Once it is in place, restart Xcode, and you should have a "About GTM Xcode Plugin" menu item under the Xcode menu. If you don't have this item, please check the location you installed it and try again.
